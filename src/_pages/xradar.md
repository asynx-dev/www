Xradar is a special section in our [blog]({% link _pages/blog.md %}).
We try to keep up with what's happening in our fields of interest, announce and
talk about current posts or news from asynx.dev community every two weeks
(hopefully) with **Xradar** posts. Xradar posts are prepared in both English
and Turkish but unfortunately videos are only in Turkish (for now).

If you [follow us]({% link _pages/follow.md %}), you will be get notified when
a new Xradar post is published. You can also **subscribe via e-mail** for Xradar

You can unsubscribe from the list at any time. If we don't publish a Xradar post,
you won't get an e-mail.
