This project is stale, we are not updating the calendar. This page is kept for
archival purposes.
{: .notice--warning}

[Calendar](https://github.com/asynx-dev/calendar) is our another open source
project where we try to list events related to topics that most of the time we
are working on (electronics/embedded/FPGA/software).

You can view each calendar (for now, only one calendar: Free Virtual (Online)
Events) on this page. Furthermore [iCalendar,
iCal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) (`.ics`) files provided for
calendars. These files are updated regularly and you can **add these calendars
to you favorite calendar software** by subscribing them. Subscription steps are
given at the bottom of the page.

# Subscribe

Calendars can be added your any calendar software supporting iCal.

**Please** do not download iCal files (`.ics`) and import them your calendar
software. If you do this, you will get the current snapshot of calendars and
once you import them your calendar will not be synced with our calendars in the
future. **You should add or import the iCal URLs, not the files!**
