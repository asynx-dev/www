# asynx.dev name ve visuals

`.dev` stands for **developers**. `asynx` has multiple meanings. Since we
also working with embedded Linux, we had to have `x`. `asyn` stands for
**asynchronous**. This term is widely used in digital electronics. Sometimes
we work on very distinct topics we stay *asynchronous* to us, this is other
meaning of `asyn`.

This is one of visuals. The bar over `asyn` imitates `active low` signal. `X`
stands for LinuX and also demonstrates a digital signal transform.

This is another visual. We use this visual as logo. Each line of `X` is in a
different color and one line is not straight.
