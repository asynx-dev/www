# TL;DR

**Use an ad blocker to limit tracking to minimum.**

You may also tweak your browser settings related to privacy. Even if you do it,
hosting platforms (we use GitHub Pages + Cloudflare) logs your IP address and
visited URLs (like all servers). After some time, logs are deleted (hopefully).
We don't have control their log rotation mechanisms.

We use Google Analytics, Google Adsense, Statcounter, Cloudflare Web Analytics
and Disqus as a 3rd party services. Also some 3rd party font and JavaScript
libraries are included. Using an ad blocker will probably deny all possible
tracking codes from all these services which is fine for us.
