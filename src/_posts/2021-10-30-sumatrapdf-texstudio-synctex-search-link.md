I use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) for my LaTeX works.
[SumatraPDF]({% post_url 2021-10-29-sumatrapdf %}) is also
good, lightweight PDF reader. It is possible to create a forward search from
TeXstudio to SumatraPDF. You may find PDF output of a LaTeX code. Similarly, a
backward search is possible: find LaTeX source code from PDF output.

Given steps are tested by using **TeXstudio 2.10.8** and **SumatraPDF v3.1.1
64-bit** on a **Windows 7 64-bit** machine. However, I am pretty sure it will
work for almost all possible future and previous versions.

This post will be based on this article
(`http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/texstudio-sumatrapdf/` `404 ðŸ”—`) But since it
was published in 2011, there are some slight changes in software menus. You may
also read it.

1- Open TexStudio. Navigate **Options** â†’ **Configure TeXstutdioâ€¦**

![Configure TeXstudioâ€¦](/assets/images/blog/21/6-a.png)

*Configure TeXstudioâ€¦*

2- Click **Commands** tab, and find **External PDF Viewer** option.

![External PDF Viewerâ€¦](/assets/images/blog/21/6-b.png)

*External PDF Viewerâ€¦*

3- Change the field with:

```text
"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" -reuse-instance %.pdf
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

**Update (08 Feb 2015):** I use pdflatex. According to Vojtech Vozda (see
comments), if you use DVI â†’ PS â†’ PDF chain you should also add -synctex=1 option
to LaTeX part as in PdfLaTeX option in order to create search link between your
source code and PDF file. See also: [What exactly is
SyncTeX?](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/118489/what-exactly-is-synctex)
{: .notice--info}

4- Click **Build** tab, find **PDF Viewer** option and change it to **External
PDF Viewer.**

![Use External PDF Viewer](/assets/images/blog/21/6-c.png)

*Use External PDF Viewer*

5- On the same windows, locate **User Commands** tab.

![User Commands](/assets/images/blog/21/6-d.png)

*User Commands*

Add the following statements:

```text
user0:Forward Search
```

to the first column and

```text
dde:///"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe":SUMATRA/control/  [ForwardSearch("?am.pdf","?c:am.tex",@,0,0,1)]
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

Click **OK**

6- Now letâ€™s open **Options** â†’ **Configure TeXstutdioâ€¦** again and select
**Shortcuts** tab. Expand **Menus** â†’ **Tools** â†’ **User** tree. Now you should
see a user command called **Forward Search**. Now its default shortcut is
**Alt+Shift+F1**. But you can also assign another shortcut to forward search
like **F2**. But this step is optional.

![User Commands Shortcut](/assets/images/blog/21/6-e.png)

*User Commands Shortcut*

7- Now we are done with TeXstudio. Letâ€™s set up SumatraPDF. Open SumatraPDF.
Click **Settings** â†’ **Options**.

![Sumatra Settings](/assets/images/blog/21/6-f.png)

*Sumatra Settings*

8- Locate **Set inverse search command-line**.

**Update (19 Feb 2016):** 8.a is added.
{: .notice--info}

8.a- If you donâ€™t see "Set inverse search command-line" option and options
window is ended by "SumatraPDF is your default PDF reader" button, first do this
step.

Run the following command. (Windows Start â†’ Search for cmd.exe â†’ Open cmd.exe â†’
Paste the following code â†’ Press Enter)

```text
"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" -inverse-search
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

This command will open SumatraPDF but it will give a loading error. This isnâ€™t
important. Now open options again and you should see the inverse search option
as given below.

![Sumatra Inverse Search](/assets/images/blog/21/6-g.png)

*Sumatra Inverse Search*

Type:

```text
"C:\Program Files (x86)\TeXstudio\texstudio.exe" "%f" -line %l
```

You should put **your** path to texstudio.exe between quotation marks.

Click **OK** and exit.

Now **letâ€™s try your new setup.**

Compile a LaTeX code in TeXstudio and produce PDF output. If you press **F2**
(if you assign that shortcut in TeXstudio settings), SumatraPDF should highlight
corresponding output of your cursor position. In SumatraPDF, double-clicking
shows corresponding LaTeX code in TeXstudio.
