Deployment process is automated with
Github Actions. In order to update the site, create a new branch from latest
commit (preferably) on `master` branch, do changes, push the new branch and
create a pull request (PR). Necessary tests will be run automatically after
PR and if all pass a maintainer will merge changes.
